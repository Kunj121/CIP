.. MY Proj documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Wed Feb 14 16:47:54 2024.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to My Blank Project's documentation!
============================================

The purpose of the project is to serve as a template for creating a new project.
The idea is that you can substitute your own code and documentation into
the placeholders here.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

   _notebook_build/_01_example_notebook.ipynb
   _notebook_build/_02_interactive_plot_example.ipynb
   myst_markdown_demos.md
   notebooks.md
   apidocs/index

Notes
=====

- Note that I have included the notebooks here twice. This is just to
  demonstrate how you can create subsections with child pages in the table of
  contents. You can read more about this
  [here.](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax/organising_content.html#using-toctree-to-include-other-documents-as-children)
- Note that you can segment your TOC in a fun way with emojis as done here:
  `MyST-Parser documentation
  <https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_. See the `.md`
  source `here
  <https://github.com/executablebooks/MyST-Parser/blob/d448abf395c29bb649f81fba5c1a2bc49e195cc0/docs/index.md?plain=1>`_
  to see how to do this.
- Because we're using Sphinx with the MySt extention, we can use Markdown almost
  everywhere. However, we still need to use it at least on the `index.rst` file.
  Here is a link to a [RestructuredText
  Cheatsheet.](https://github.com/ralsina/rst-cheatsheet/blob/master/rst-cheatsheet.rst)
- I'm using ``autodoc2`` to create the API documentation. This is a fork of the
  original ``autodoc`` extension that allows you to use Markdown in your docstrings.
  You can read more about it [here](https://sphinx-autodoc2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
  The differences between this and the original ``autodoc`` are documented [here](https://sphinx-autodoc2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autodoc_diff.html).
