CIP Arbitrage Spread
=============================================

## About this project

This project is a replication of the Covered Interest Parity(CIP). A CIP deviation is a spread a cash riskliss rate 
and a syntehtic riskless rate. The synthetic rate is a local currency borrowing swapped into a foriegn denominated rate 
using cross currency derivatives. 


## Quick Start

To quickest way to run code in this repo is to use the following steps. First clone this github repository and open in the 
IDE of your choice. Then make sure to install all the requirements using
and then install the dependencies with pip. Make sure you have an environment in your terminal set as well. 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Finally, you can then run 
```
doit
```
And that's it!

If you would also like to run the R code included in this project, you can either install
R and the required packages manually, or you can use the included `environment.yml` file.
To do this, run
```
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```
I'm using `mamba` here because `conda` is too slow. Activate the environment. 
Then, make sure to uncomment
out the RMarkdown task from the `dodo.py` file. Then,
run `doit` as before.

### Other commands

#### Unit Tests and Doc Tests

You can run the unit test, including doctests, with the following command:
```
pytest --doctest-modules
```
You can build the documentation with:
```
rm ./src/.pytest_cache/README.md 
jupyter-book build -W ./
```
Use `del` instead of rm on Windows

#### Setting Environment Variables

You can 
[export your environment variables](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43267413/how-to-set-environment-variables-from-env-file) 
from your `.env` files like so, if you wish. This can be done easily in a Linux or Mac terminal with the following command:
```
set -a ## automatically export all variables
source .env
set +a
```
In Windows, this can be done with the included `set_env.bat` file,
```
set_env.bat
```

### General Directory Structure

 - The `assets` folder is used for things like hand-drawn figures or other
   pictures that were not generated from code. These things cannot be easily
   recreated if they are deleted.

 - The `_output` folder, on the other hand, contains dataframes and figures that are
   generated from code. The entire folder should be able to be deleted, because
   the code can be run again, which would again generate all of the contents.

 - The `data_manual` is for data that cannot be easily recreated. This data
   should be version controlled. Anything in the `_data` folder or in
   the `_output` folder should be able to be recreated by running the code
   and can safely be deleted.

 - I'm using the `doit` Python module as a task runner. It works like `make` and
   the associated `Makefile`s. To rerun the code, install `doit`
   (https://pydoit.org/) and execute the command `doit` from the `src`
   directory. Note that doit is very flexible and can be used to run code
   commands from the command prompt, thus making it suitable for projects that
   use scripts written in multiple different programming languages.

 - I'm using the `.env` file as a container for absolute paths that are private
   to each collaborator in the project. You can also use it for private
   credentials, if needed. It should not be tracked in Git.

### Data and Output Storage

I'll often use a separate folder for storing data. Any data in the data folder
can be deleted and recreated by rerunning the PyDoit command (the pulls are in
the dodo.py file). Any data that cannot be automatically recreated should be
stored in the "data_manual" folder. Because of the risk of manually-created data
getting changed or lost, I prefer to keep it under version control if I can.
Thus, data in the "_data" folder is excluded from Git (see the .gitignore file),
while the "data_manual" folder is tracked by Git.

Output is stored in the "_output" directory. This includes dataframes, charts, and
rendered notebooks. When the output is small enough, I'll keep this under
version control. I like this because I can keep track of how dataframes change as my
analysis progresses, for example.

Of course, the _data directory and _output directory can be kept elsewhere on the
machine. To make this easy, I always include the ability to customize these
locations by defining the path to these directories in environment variables,
which I intend to be defined in the `.env` file, though they can also simply be
defined on the command line or elsewhere. The `settings.py` is reponsible for
loading these environment variables and doing some like preprocessing on them.
The `settings.py` file is the entry point for all other scripts to these
definitions. That is, all code that references these variables and others are
loading by importing `config`.
